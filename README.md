# Bravo

## Background

Bravo is a full stack clone of the popular social network for athletes called Strava. It was built with a Ruby on Rails backend, a PostgreSQL database, and a JavaScript React/Redux frontend. Bravo features extensive calls to various Google Maps APIs to allow real-time rendering of user-created bike routes. It also has CRUD functionality for rides and comments and partial CRUD for users and kudos (likes).

# Technologies

* The frontend is coded in JavaScript
* React and Redux were used to render components and manage state
* Ruby was used to code the routes, models, and controllers
* A rails framework tied this code to a PostgreSQL database
* Management of geographic data was enabled through calls to Google Maps, Elevation, and Directions APIs
* Static map imagery provided by the Google Static Maps API
